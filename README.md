# slightly-improved-tab-groups (SITG)

This is a Firefox addon for its new Tab Groups feature that adds the slightest bit of features
to make it more usable (it doesn't support chrome because it uses Firefox features
and idk why you would want to use this on chrome)

New tabs created in tab groups inherit the first tab in the group's container.
