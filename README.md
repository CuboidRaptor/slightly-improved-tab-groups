# slightly-improved-tab-groups (SITG)

This is a Firefox addon for its new Tab Groups feature (it doesn't support chrome because it uses
firefox features and idk why you would want to use this on chrome)

Tab Groups but I added the slightest of features to make it more usable for myself

New tabs created in tab groups or not inherit the first tab in the group/window's container.
